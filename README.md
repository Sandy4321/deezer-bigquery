Replicate the experiment
------------------------

### Setting-up your environment
- Create a Google Cloud project
- Set-up your authorization details using https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/authorization#clientsecrets
- Setup BigQuery for your Google Cloud project
- Copy `config.py.dist` into `config.py` and edit your project details

### Loading the dataset
- Run `load.py` and accept the oAuth screen (this will create a `bigquery_credentials.dat` file)
- Wait until it loads all JSON files from Google Cloud Storage into your Big Query project

### Querying the dataset
- Run query.py to query the dataset
- Add additional queries by creating new files in `/queries`
